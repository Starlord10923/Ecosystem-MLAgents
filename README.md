# Ecosystem-MLAgents
 
A Unity ML-Agents Simulation of Autonomous Prey-Predator Ecosystem Dynamics

Multi-Agent Prey Behavior (Completed)
    Agents dynamically balance hunger, thirst, and reproduction needs using a reward-based learning policy.
    Implements event-based environment feedback (e.g., food consumption, water availability, proximity to mating partners).
    Curriculum Learning: Tasks are introduced progressivelyâ€”starting from foraging only, to thirst management, and finally reproduction cycles.

Population Genetics & Evolution
    Each agent has inheritable traits (vision range, speed, stamina, maxLifetime) encoded into a genome-like structure.
    Reproduction introduces genetic variation and evolution across generations, stabilizing population performance over time.

Environment Randomization
    Food and water resources respawn in randomized patch zones.

In-Progress: Predator Phase
    Ongoing development of predator agents with hunting behavior, stealth mechanics, and prey selection logic.
    Targeted emergence of evolutionary arms race between prey evasiveness and predator hunting efficiency.
